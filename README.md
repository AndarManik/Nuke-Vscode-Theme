This is a low contrast light mode for VScode.

The idea of this theme is to leverage low contrast as to allow for saturated color. 
This is to address the common problem that light modes generally need the text to be much lower in lightness overall to allow for accessablity with respect to contrast ratio.

Each color in this theme is generated from oklch which lightness = 70 and chroma = 15
